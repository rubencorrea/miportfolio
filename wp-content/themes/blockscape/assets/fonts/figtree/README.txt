Figtree Variable Font
=====================

This download contains Figtree as both variable fonts and static fonts.

Figtree is a variable font with this axis:
  wght

This means all the styles are contained in these files:
  Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf
  Figtree-Italic-VariableFont_wght.ttf

If your app fully supports variable fonts, you can now pick intermediate styles
that arenâ€™t available as static fonts. Not all apps support variable fonts, and
in those cases you can use the static font files for Figtree:
  static/Figtree-Light.ttf
  static/Figtree-Regular.ttf
  static/Figtree-Medium.ttf
  static/Figtree-SemiBold.ttf
  static/Figtree-Bold.ttf
  static/Figtree-ExtraBold.ttf
  static/Figtree-Black.ttf
  static/Figtree-LightItalic.ttf
  static/Figtree-Italic.ttf
  static/Figtree-MediumItalic.ttf
  static/Figtree-SemiBoldItalic.ttf
  static/Figtree-BoldItalic.ttf
  static/Figtree-ExtraBoldItalic.ttf
  static/Figtree-BlackItalic.ttf
